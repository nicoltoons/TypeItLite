        HOW TO USE

   -🌱 Click on the Create New Json FIle button. It displays a pop-up window where you can write
            the  name of your new file and click on "Create JSON File" button.

   -🌱 After  creating the file, go to Question Count and input the number of questions you want to 
             type.

  -🌱 Click the "Create Questions" button.

 -🌱 It will display the number of question buttons that corresponds with the number you inputed 
          in the Question Count Field.

 -🌱 Each button will take you to its corresponding Question where you can type individual 
          questions.

 -🌱 To create answers for each question, add the number of answers to the answer count field 
           and click on the Create Answers button.

-🌱  This will display answer slots where you can type the answers and choose the right one.


IMPORTING FILES

 -🌱 To import a file, click on the Import JSON File

 -🌱 Choose the file you want to import and if it is in the correct format, it will clear out your 
          existing work and replace with the contents of the imported file. If you are looking to add the 
          contents of the imported file to your current work, use the 'Add Json File' button instead.

SAVING YOUR FILE

 -🌱 To save your file, click on the Download Your Work Button to save your file in JSON format.

COPYING, DELETING AND SEARCHING

 -🌱 There are 3 buttons above the question field and similar buttons on each answer field.

 -🌱 The COPY button is the first and it duplicates the highlighted question button ( the question 
          associated with it) or the active answer field.

 -🌱 The DELETE button is the middle button and it deletes the highlighted question button ( the 
           question associated with it) or the active answer field.

-🌱 The SEARCH button is the last button with the magnifying glass icon and depending on whether 
          you are on the question field or an answer field, it will search for either duplicate questions 
          through the list of questions or duplicate answers associated with the highlighted question. All 
          that's needed is a word, phase or entire sentence to search.
